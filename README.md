# 🔍 AI ATS Resume Checker

> Stop guessing. Know exactly why your resume isn't getting shortlisted.

Most resumes get rejected before a human even reads them — filtered out by ATS bots that scan for keywords. This tool tells you exactly where you stand.

## 🚀 What It Does

Upload your resume + paste a job description → get an instant ATS score with a full breakdown of what's working and what's not.

- **Overall Score** — how well your resume matches the JD
- **Section-wise Breakdown** — separate scores for Skills, Projects, and Education
- **Matched Keywords** — what's already in your resume
- **Missing Keywords** — what you need to add
- **History** — all your past checks saved automatically
